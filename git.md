`HEAD^` ancestry ref: parent of commit HEAD
`HEAD~` ancestry ref: first parent of HEAD (= `HEAD^`)

## Undoing

`git checkout ‹pathspec›` restores the named paths in the working tree from the index
`git reset --soft HEAD~1` delete the commit but leave all your changed files as `git status` would put it (if you have committed, but not pushed) [more](http://nakkaya.com/2009/09/24/git-delete-last-commit/)
`git revert HEAD` creates a new commit that reverses everything introduced by the accidental commit (if already pushed and someone pulled)

## Status

`git reflog` to see where your HEAD and branch references have been
`git show master@{yesterday}` to see where your master branch was yesterday
